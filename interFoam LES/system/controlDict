runTimeModifiable yes;                     // Switch for whether dictionaries, e.g.controlDict, are re-read during a simulation at the beginning of each time step, allowing the user to modify parameters during a simulation.

adjustTimeStep  yes;                       // yes/no Switch used by some solvers to adjust the time step during the simulation, usually according to maxCo. Large Courant numbers mean the time step ist too large. Please keep in mind: Complex geometry = many nodes = small element sizes = small time for traversing an element = high Courant number.
maxCo           0.1;                       // Maximum Courant number, e.g. 0.5, maxCo is a more general parameter that applies to various flow variables, including velocity, pressure, and scalar fields.  Lower maxCo = less courant number error breaks! There are LES simulations which require a max Co of 0.1 or even lower. 
maxAlphaCo      0.1;                       // not in v10 book, maxAlphaCo is specifically used for the phase fraction (alpha) transport equation. It limits the time step size based on the change in the phase fraction within a single time step.

// writeControl
// timeStep: Writes data every writeInterval time steps.
// runTime: Writes data every writeInterval seconds of simulated time.
// adjustableRunTime: Writes data every writeInterval seconds of simulated time, adjusting the time steps to coincide with the writeInterval if necessary — used in cases with automatic time step adjustment.
// cpuTime: Writes data every writeInterval seconds of CPU time.
// clockTime: Writes data out every writeInterval seconds of real time.
