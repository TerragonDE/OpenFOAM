// writeControl
// timeStep: Writes data every writeInterval time steps.
// runTime: Writes data every writeInterval seconds of simulated time.
// adjustableRunTime: Writes data every writeInterval seconds of simulated time, adjusting the time steps to coincide with the writeInterval if necessary — used in cases with automatic time step adjustment.
// cpuTime: Writes data every writeInterval seconds of CPU time.
// clockTime: Writes data out every writeInterval seconds of real time.
